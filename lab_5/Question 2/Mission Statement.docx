Mission statement
“Potatoes are a heritage created by humanity, to make sure humanity has access to this vital heritage is our sworn duty.”

Executive Summary
We aim at creating a website for the online retailing of potatoes. We believe that having access to food is a basic right everyone should have regardless of where a person is. This website will provide customers the opportunity to access a wide selection of quality organic and GMO potatoes at low prices to be delivered through airdrops by B-2 Spirit bombers anywhere around the world. 
This website will provide a modern way for customers to access food to satisfy the new age late-night urges common in modern societies. Most modern commercial websites such as Amazon or eBay provide a large selection of items but customers often end up buying a large number of random items that do not offer them the happiness they seek while browsing the online shop. Our shop offers only one type of product, potatoes. Potato is a universally recognized food providing happiness by fighting hunger. Some potatoes are so beautiful they can satisfy the need for art and beauty each and everyone human naturally seek. 
People in poor regions of the world will be able to order potatoes online and expect potatoes to land within 10 meters of their location within 8 hours. Potatoes of many sizes will be available, ranging from 100grams to 100kg. Customers can select the potatoes they wish to purchase and place them in the shopping cart. We will accept 3 types of payment: Paypal, Mastercard, and Visa. After making a successful payment, new customers can enter their address while second-time customers will have a faster payment experience. A B-2 Spirit bomber will be immediately launched towards the customer location equipped with the entirety of their purchase. An air-drop will occur within 8 hours at the customer’s location. The customer can review the product online if they survive the air-drop.
